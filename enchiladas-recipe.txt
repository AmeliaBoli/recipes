Swiss Green Enchiladas

Ingredients:

 -2  1/2 cups of “salsa verde” ( you can find the recipe here)
 -1/2 cup Mexican cream or sour cream
 -1/2 cup chopped cilantro
 -2 cups of (fully cooked) shredded chicken (leftover rotisserie chicken is also ok)
 -1 cup shredded Mexican Chihuahua cheese or your choice of Swiss Cheese or Monterrey 
 Cheese
 - 12 corn tortillas
 -1/2 medium onion thinly sliced
 -2 tablespoon vegetable oil for frying

Instructions:

1. Place Salsa verde, Mexican Cream and cilantro in a blender, process until you have a smooth sauce. Set aside.

2. Heat a skillet over medium heat; warm oil and dip the tortillas one at a time into 
the oil to soften, giving it just a few seconds per side. Besides softening them for  
easy rolling, another of the reasons that we do this is to avoid the tortillas from 
breaking. I prefer to brush the tortillas and then warm them in a skillet to use less 
oil. Transfer onto a plate covered with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Preheat 
oven to 350°F.

3. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. You can also add garlic powder if you like.

4. Fill the center of each tortilla with the chicken and roll it up.

5. Spread 1/3 sauce in a 9" baking dish.

6. Divide shredded chicken evenly among tortillas, roll them up, and arrange the 
enchiladas in 1 layer, seam side down.

7. Cover with the rest of sauce; sprinkle with cheese. Bake 30 minutes or until cheese 
starts to brown. Serve immediately
